I was born in Australia where my family has been for a few generations and the highest level of education I have done is high school.

I’ve had an interest in IT since my early life where I was a very curious about the way things worked and the earliest event I can remember is my dad letting me take apart our computer to see how things went together. 

To date my experience with IT has been mostly enthusiast level with building and upgrading my personal PCs over the past few years. 

I chose RMIT because the course listed should help me attain my goal of entering the field of IT and the online course makes it fit easily in me schedule. 

Through my studies I expect to learn the skills I will need to start a career in the IT field. 

 

 

Ideal job
=========

[Link to job here](https://www.seek.com.au/job/38578690?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=dbbc63ef-102e-4a3d-9978-dfc199ee4cbd)

My ideal job would probably be a Sofware engineer as I find the problem solving and debugging aspect of programing to be quite fun. 

As part of this job I expect to develop maintain and update software to solve a specific problem, the exact details of the problem doesn't matter too much to me over the challenge of the problem itself. 

For this job I will need a good understanding of the programming languages being used in industry (C++), a degree in IT and some experience in the field. 

I plan to finish my degree though RMIT and this should also assist in learning C++. For the experience I could try to get a job in QA to show my critical thinking skills or try to get a junior software engineer position.  

 

Psychometric tests 
==================
## Myers-Briggs

To me this test affirms my identity as a very logical thinker and while it shows that I am flexible on the approach to a solution I have little regard for wrong or inefficient solutions. 

These results show that I have tendency to point out issues without regard for how doing so might affect other’s feelings. I have noticed me doing this in my work place already but as we all get along it comes off as constructive criticism. However, I do recognize how this could be an issue to some people. 

When considering this result, it might be a good idea to try to recognize any in the group that would not appreciate my blunt nature. 

Also knowing my type of thinking it would a good idea to have people with other thought process to challenge my ideas to make sure they hold up to scrutiny. 

## Learning style test

To me this test exemplifies my poor ability to learn through auditory means which overall is not that surprising to me. It also shows that while I am by majority a tactile learner it is not a dominating method meaning I can be flexible through the situations I find myself in the future. 

These results could affect teamwork if most of the group has the same learning style it could stifle different outlooks on the problem leading to possibly inefficient solutions. 

From that idea we can see that having a mix of leaning styles in a group can increase the paths looked at to a solution. 

## Abstract reasoning

An abstract reasoning test maybe used by an employer when assessing someone for a job that requires a high level of creative thinking such as my dream job (software engineer). This test shows that I have abstract reasoning which is a good sign for getting my dream job. 

Overall having abstract thinking in a group is a good idea but if everyone was an abstract thinker the group might gloss over some of the more mundane solutions which could do more harm than good. 

So when forming a group having more of a mix maybe a better idea. 

IT project  
==========

The project idea I have is to break the standard industry thinking on wearable technology by creating multiple smaller devices to wear that are worn together instead of one like what is currently produced. For example, having a glove used for user input through gesturers, using a pair of glasses as a display only and having a central processor that the user carries i.e. a phone. This is contrast to the HoloLens that Microsoft is producing which they try to put all those parts into one device that the user wears on their head. 

My motivation for this is to address the issue that can arise by having everything on only one device. These issues can range from the devices being too heavy to wear, especially for extended periods to better customizability on the features gained and easier upgradability/replicability. 

The project will have a pair of glasses that act as the display for the device. Having glasses that only act as a display we can reduce the weight and complexity of the device making it more comfortable to wear and utilize the savings by increasing the battery and decrees cost over current products in market. 

The project will also have a glove for user input through gestures. Moving the user inputs to a dedicated device that works through touch will assist in higher accuracy of the gestures and as the technology is much more mature it should be easier to manufacture and more intuitive for that average user that us used to interacting though touch on phones and laptops. 

The last critical component of this project is a central processer. This could be a simple as utilizing the users’ smart phone, which becomes a more viable option with every new generation of phone. We could also create a more purpose-built device if it is determined that smart phones aren’t powerful enough yet. As a more future proof idea we could enable the glove and glasses pair to connect to any computer and allow for a user to control multiple devices at once turning the project into the next generation of interface. 

The tools needed to create this project mostly already exist in the industry now as this project is more of a re-thinking of already existing technology rather than a brand-new concept. We could use the screen from an AR/VR headset as the base for the glasses and modify it to remove anything not needed to get the screens going. The gloves can be made from [flexible touchpad technology](https://www.livescience.com/58280-transparent-touchpad-can-bend-and-stretch.html) allowing for a thin design. For the central processor the simplest solution would be to use the users’ phone which would require the development of a screen sharing app. 

The skills that we will need will be some software engineering to make an app/program that can link between our device and a phone or computer allowing for control. We will also need some hardware engineers that are accustomed to working with current gen AR/VR equipment to help piece everything together. Overall it shouldn’t hard to find people with these skills out in the workforce as the individual parts we need are already in the market place.  

This project will be successful when not only would devices made be a ubiquitous as the smart phone is today but also cause a mentality shift in the industry that shows the tech companies that the concept of the internet of things can be extended to a single device.
